        description: "The total latency in milliseconds between a proxy sending a
          request to a backend and receiving the last byte of response. For Service
          Extensions, this measures the summed latencies of each request/response
          pair between the load balancer and extension backends. Sampled every 60
          seconds, data is not visible for up to 210 seconds after sampling."
